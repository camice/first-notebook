# 1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility

Monya Baker
25 May 2016

## Reproducibilty Crisis

**More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist’s experiments**, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature’s* survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research.

The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant ‘crisis’ of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.

### The Survey

In the survey[^2] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibilty in science. Below is the list order by the most highly rated:

  * Better understanding of statistics
  * Better mentoring/supervision
  * More robust design
  * Better teaching
  * More within-lab validation
  * Incentives for better practice
  * Incentives for formal reproduction
  * More external-lab validation
  * More time for mentoring
  * Journals enforcing standards
  * More time checking notebooks
